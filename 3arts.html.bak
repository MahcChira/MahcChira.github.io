The Mind Body and soul all represented here take mant forms all fully divorced from eachother. Yet a lines of thought unavoidably link them all together.
<br/>
Body: Wake depicts a Knight clad in armor leaving his wake through the Galexy reflecting below him. His armor is all defending, but cannot hide the fear of the finite. Yet in his reflection, his wake, there is no fear.
<br/>
Mind: Paths Displays the endless paths and worlds a creative mind can long for and desire to escape within. These ideas and dreams breach through the cloud of thought far greater then any other ideas.
<br/>
Soul: Remains Showcases whats left beyond the mortal, what beauty absence can create. After life plays its course, whats left is a a void, but this void may serve as a lens into the life well lived.
