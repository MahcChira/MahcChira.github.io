<h1 style="color:red;"> Painting with CSS project</h1>
<p>The inspiration for this Rose horizontal mimicry was what I thought would allow me to duplicate the art minimalisticly. 
<br/>
The methods I used were creating a margin to move the image to the center of the screen, then duplicating the exact Same box twenty five times in a row. 
<br/>
Never the less this mostly project required many RGB color changes to result in a copy of Rosa horizontal.
